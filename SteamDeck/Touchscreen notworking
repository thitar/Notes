# Touchscreen not working anymore

If your touchscreen stops responding, a simple reboot is not enough to clear the issue. However, you can reset the touchscreen by putting the Steam Deck into battery storage mode:

* Power the Steam Deck down normally (choose Shut Down from the Power menu)
* Hold down the Volume+ button and press the power button. The Steam Deck should boot into the BIOS menu.
* Using the D-Pad and A to select, navigate to "Setup Utility"
* Navigate to the Power Menu
* Choose Battery storage mode, and confirm.

You should see the Steam Deck power off, and the power LED will blink three times to confirm battery storage mode.

Wait a few minutes, then plug the Steam Deck in to the provided power supply and turn on the Steam Deck.
