## Use DNS for port
Great question, Thierry ‚Äî and it‚Äôs one that trips up a lot of homelab enthusiasts early on. DNS itself doesn‚Äôt handle ports. It only resolves domain names to IP addresses. So when you type `app.home.cyber-bronkx.com`, DNS tells your browser the IP address, but it‚Äôs up to your browser (or client) to decide which port to connect to ‚Äî usually defaulting to port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

So how do you get around the ‚Äúport problem‚Äù when hosting multiple apps on the same IP? That‚Äôs where a **reverse proxy** comes in. Here's how it works:

---

## üß≠ Why DNS Can't Handle Ports

- DNS maps **hostnames to IP addresses**, not ports.
- You can't create a DNS record like `app1.home.cyber-bronkx.com:8080` ‚Äî the `:8080` part is handled by the browser, not DNS.
- So if you have multiple services on the same IP but different ports, DNS alone can't help you route traffic cleanly.

## üîÄ Enter the Reverse Proxy

A **reverse proxy** acts as a smart traffic director. It listens on standard ports (80/443) and forwards requests to the correct internal service based on the hostname or path.

### Example Setup:
| Hostname | Internal Port | Docker Service |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| `app1.home.cyber-bronkx.com` | 8081 | App 1 |
| `app2.home.cyber-bronkx.com` | 8082 | App 2 |

With a reverse proxy (like **NGINX**, **Traefik**, or **Caddy**), you can:
- Route `app1.home.cyber-bronkx.com` to `localhost:8081`
- Route `app2.home.cyber-bronkx.com` to `localhost:8082`
- All traffic comes in on port 80/443, and the proxy handles the rest.

## üß∞ Recommended Reverse Proxies

| Proxy | Pros | Docker-Friendly? |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **NGINX** | Powerful, widely used | ‚úÖ |
| **Traefik** | Auto-discovers Docker containers, great for dynamic setups | ‚úÖ‚úÖ |
| **Caddy** | Easiest HTTPS setup, automatic TLS | ‚úÖ |

For Docker-heavy environments, **Traefik** is especially popular because it can read Docker labels and configure routes automatically.

## üß† How This Fits Into Your Homelab

- Use **Pi-Hole** to resolve `*.home.cyber-bronkx.com` to your reverse proxy‚Äôs IP.
- Use a reverse proxy to route traffic based on hostname.
- Keep your Docker services isolated and clean ‚Äî no more port juggling.
