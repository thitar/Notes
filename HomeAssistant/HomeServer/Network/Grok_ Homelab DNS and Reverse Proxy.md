###Grok: Homelab DNS and Reverse Proxy
###Key Points
- **Pi-Hole for Local DNS**: Pi-Hole can manage local DNS resolution by setting it as your network’s DNS server and adding custom DNS records for devices and services, making it easier to access them with friendly names like `server1.local`.
- **Reverse Proxy Utility**: A reverse proxy routes traffic to multiple services on the same IP using hostnames, simplifies SSL management, and enhances security, which is ideal for your homelab with multiple servers and containers.
- **Network Organization**: Using consistent naming conventions and static IPs or DHCP reservations ensures reliable DNS resolution; leveraging your domain `cyber-bronkc.com` can streamline internal and external access.
- **External Access**: With `home.cyber-bronkc.com` pointing to your router, a reverse proxy can enable secure external access to services, provided proper security measures like HTTPS are implemented.

### Setting Up Pi-Hole for Local DNS
Have you considered how your devices currently find each other on your network? To use Pi-Hole for local DNS resolution, you’ll first need to ensure it’s the primary DNS server for your network. Why might it be important to have all devices use Pi-Hole for DNS queries? You can configure your router’s DHCP settings to point to Pi-Hole’s IP address, or manually set each device to use Pi-Hole. Which approach do you think would be more manageable for your homelab?

Once set up, Pi-Hole’s web interface allows you to add custom DNS records. For instance, you could map `server1.local` to `192.168.1.100`. What kind of naming scheme would make it easiest to remember your servers and services? You can also use Pi-Hole as a DHCP server to automatically register device hostnames. How might automating hostname registration simplify your network management?

### Using a Reverse Proxy
What challenges do you face when accessing multiple services running on different ports or servers? A reverse proxy can help by routing traffic based on hostnames, allowing you to access services like `app.local` without specifying ports. Popular tools like Nginx or Traefik can be configured to forward requests to the correct backend service. How could consolidating access to a single IP and port improve your workflow? For your setup with VMs and Docker containers, a reverse proxy can streamline access and add security. What security benefits might come from hiding backend servers behind a proxy?

### Network Organization
How do you currently keep track of your servers, VMs, and containers? Using a consistent naming convention, like `service-name.local` or subdomains of `cyber-bronkc.com`, can make navigation intuitive. Why might static IPs or DHCP reservations be critical for reliable DNS resolution? Since `home.cyber-bronkc.com` points to your router, you could use subdomains like `app.home.cyber-bronkc.com` for external access. What considerations would you need to make to ensure secure external access?

# Comprehensive Guide to Using Pi-Hole for Local DNS, Reverse Proxy, and Network Organization

## Introduction
This guide explores how to configure Pi-Hole for local DNS resolution in your homelab, which includes servers, Proxmox, virtual machines (VMs), and Docker containers. It also explains the role of a reverse proxy in managing multiple services and provides recommendations for organizing your network. Given that you own the domain `cyber-bronkc.com` with the DNS entry `home.cyber-bronkc.com` pointing to your router, we’ll also discuss how to leverage this for internal and external access. Let’s dive into the process with a series of questions to guide your understanding and implementation.

## Setting Up Pi-Hole for Local DNS Resolution

### 1. Configuring Pi-Hole as the DNS Server
Why is it essential for all devices in your network to use a single DNS server like Pi-Hole? Pi-Hole must be set as the primary DNS server to handle all DNS queries, including local resolutions and ad blocking. There are two primary methods to achieve this:

- **Router DHCP Configuration**: Access your router’s admin panel and set Pi-Hole’s IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.2`) as the primary DNS server in the DHCP settings. This ensures all devices receiving IP addresses from the router use Pi-Hole automatically. What advantages might this centralized approach offer for your homelab?
- **Manual Device Configuration**: Alternatively, configure each device to use Pi-Hole’s IP as its DNS server. This is useful if your router doesn’t allow DNS customization, but why might this be less practical for a network with many devices?

To verify Pi-Hole is handling DNS, check the dashboard at `http://<pi-hole-ip>/admin` to see query logs. If devices bypass Pi-Hole by using other DNS servers, ad blocking and local DNS resolution may not work. How could you ensure all devices adhere to using Pi-Hole?

### 2. Adding Local DNS Records
How would you like to access your servers and services—by IP addresses or user-friendly names? Pi-Hole’s “Local DNS” feature allows you to create custom DNS records, mapping names like `server1.local` to IP addresses. Follow these steps:

1. Log into the Pi-Hole web interface.
2. Navigate to **Local DNS** > **DNS Records**.
3. Add an A record:
   - **Domain**: `server1.local`
   - **IP Address**: `192.168.1.100`
   - Click **Add**.
4. For services sharing an IP but using different ports, consider how a reverse proxy (discussed later) can help, as DNS resolves to IPs, not ports.
5. Optionally, add CNAME records for aliases, e.g., `webapp.local` pointing to `server1.local`. Why might CNAME records be useful if a server’s IP changes frequently?

**Choosing a Local Domain**:
What makes a domain name effective for local use? Common choices include `.lan` or `.home`, but avoid `.local` due to potential conflicts with multicast DNS (mDNS) used by services like Bonjour. Since you own `cyber-bronkc.com`, you could use a subdomain like `local.cyber-bronkc.com` for internal records (e.g., `server1.local.cyber-bronkc.com`). This leverages your domain while avoiding conflicts with public DNS records. What factors would influence your choice of domain suffix?

| DNS Record Type | Purpose | Example |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| A Record        | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address | `server1.local` → `192.168.1.100` |
| AAAA Record     | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address | `server1.local` → `2001:db8::1` |
| CNAME Record    | Aliases one domain to another | `webapp.local` → `server1.local` |

### 3. Using Pi-Hole as a DHCP Server (Optional)
How could automating IP and hostname assignments simplify your network management? Pi-Hole can act as a DHCP server, assigning IP addresses and registering hostnames automatically. This is particularly useful for devices that provide hostnames via DHCP. Here’s how to set it up:

1. In the Pi-Hole web interface, go to **Settings** > **DHCP**.
2. Enable the DHCP server and specify the IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.100-200`).
3. Set the “Pi-hole domain name” to your chosen local domain, e.g., `lan`.
4. Disable your router’s DHCP server to avoid conflicts.
5. Devices reporting hostnames (e.g., `laptop`) will be registered as `laptop.lan`.

What risks might arise if Pi-Hole, as the DHCP server, goes offline? While DHCP leases persist until expiration, new devices may not receive IPs, and DNS resolution could fail. Consider a secondary Pi-Hole instance for redundancy. How would you balance the convenience of Pi-Hole’s DHCP with network reliability?

**Alternative**: If you prefer using your router’s DHCP server, you can manually add hostname-to-IP mappings in Pi-Hole’s `/etc/hosts` file. However, this requires ongoing maintenance. Which approach aligns better with your homelab’s needs?

## Implementing a Reverse Proxy

### What is a Reverse Proxy?
Imagine accessing multiple services like a web app and a monitoring tool without remembering their specific IPs or ports. How could that improve your homelab experience? A reverse proxy receives client requests and forwards them to the appropriate backend server based on the hostname or path. It’s particularly useful in a homelab with multiple services running on VMs or Docker containers.

**Benefits**:
- **Unified Access**: Host multiple services on a single IP and port (e.g., port 80 or 443) using hostnames like `app.local` and `monitor.local`.
- **SSL Termination**: Manage HTTPS certificates centrally, allowing backend services to use HTTP.
- **Security**: Hide backend server details and add authentication layers.

### Setting Up a Reverse Proxy
What tools are you familiar with for managing web traffic? Popular reverse proxy software includes Nginx, Traefik, and Caddy. Here’s a basic setup using Nginx:

1. **Install Nginx**: Deploy Nginx on a server or Docker container in your homelab.
2. **Configure Virtual Hosts**: Create configuration files to route traffic based on hostnames. For example:


```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.local;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.100:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name monitor.local;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.100:9090;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.local;

        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.100:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name monitor.local;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.100:9090;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
</xaiArtifact>
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name app.local;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.1.100:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name monitor.local;
    location / {

        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```


3. **Set DNS Records**: In Pi-Hole, add A records for `app.local` and `monitor.local` pointing to the reverse proxy’s IP (e.g., `192.168.1.2`).
4. **Test Access**: Access services via `http://app.local` and `http://monitor.local`. How would you verify that traffic is routing correctly?

For HTTPS, consider using Let’s Encrypt with Certbot to obtain free SSL certificates. What additional security measures might you implement to protect your services?

### Integration with Your Domain
Since `home.cyber-bronkc.com` points to your router’s public IP, how could you use it to access services externally? Configure your reverse proxy to handle subdomains like `app.home.cyber-bronkc.com`. Set up port forwarding on your router for ports 80 and 443 to the reverse proxy’s IP. Add corresponding A records in your domain registrar’s DNS settings. What risks should you consider when exposing services to the internet?

## Network Organization Recommendations

### 1. Consistent Naming Convention
How can a clear naming scheme improve your network’s usability? Adopt a consistent convention, such as:
- **Devices**: `server1.lan`, `printer.lan`
- **Services**: `webapp.lan`, `monitor.lan`
- **Subdomains**: `web.app.lan` for related services

Using subdomains of `cyber-bronkc.com` (e.g., `server1.local.cyber-bronkc.com`) can integrate with your public domain while keeping local records distinct. What naming structure would best suit your homelab’s complexity?

### 2. Static IPs or DHCP Reservations
Why is it critical for DNS records to point to consistent IPs? Assign static IPs to servers and services or use DHCP reservations in your router or Pi-Hole to ensure IPs remain constant. This prevents DNS records from becoming outdated. How do you currently manage IP assignments in your homelab?

| Device/Service | IP Address | DNS Record | Notes |
|----------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Proxmox Server | 192.168.1.10 | proxmox.lan | Static IP |
| Web App Container | 192.168.1.100:8080 | webapp.lan | Via Reverse Proxy |
| Monitoring Tool | 192.168.1.100:9090 | monitor.lan | Via Reverse Proxy |

### 3. Documentation
How do you keep track of your network’s configuration? Maintain a document listing IP addresses, hostnames, ports, and service details. Tools like a wiki or spreadsheet can help. What documentation method would work best for you?

### 4. Security Considerations
What steps can you take to secure your homelab? Consider:
- **VLANs**: Segment sensitive services (e.g., IoT devices) from critical servers.
- **Updates**: Regularly update Pi-Hole, reverse proxy software, and other components.
- **Monitoring**: Use Pi-Hole’s query logs and network monitoring tools to detect anomalies.

For external access, implement HTTPS, firewalls, and possibly authentication (e.g., via reverse proxy plugins). How would you prioritize security in your setup?

## External Access with Your Domain
Given that `home.cyber-bronkc.com` points to your router, how can you safely expose services? Configure your reverse proxy to handle subdomains like `app.home.cyber-bronkc.com`. Steps include:
1. Set up port forwarding for ports 80 and 443 to the reverse proxy.
2. Add A records in your domain registrar for subdomains pointing to your public IP.
3. Use Let’s Encrypt for SSL certificates to secure connections.
4. Consider a firewall or VPN for additional security.

What services would you want to access externally, and how would you ensure they’re protected?

## Conclusion
By configuring Pi-Hole for local DNS, setting up a reverse proxy, and organizing your network with consistent naming and IP management, you can create an efficient and accessible homelab. Leveraging your domain `cyber-bronkc.com` allows for seamless internal and external access, provided security is prioritized. What aspects of this setup are you most excited to implement, and what challenges do you foresee?
