# Copilot: Comprehensive Guide to Building an Optimized Homelab Network with Pi-hole, Reverse Proxy, and Custom Domain

## Introduction

A robust homelab network empowers you to host services—such as web servers, media platforms, and smart home controllers—within your own environment. By integrating **Pi-hole** for local DNS resolution, employing a **reverse proxy** for secure access, and leveraging your own **domain name** (e.g., `home.cyber-bronkc.com`), you can create a flexible, efficient, and secure infrastructure. This guide covers:

- Step-by-step **Pi-hole installation** and **local DNS** record management
- Recommendations for **network organization** and **VM/container** hosting best practices
- **Reverse proxy** concepts, comparisons, and integration techniques
- Guidance on using a **custom domain** and **dynamic DNS** for external access
- **Router** configuration, **port forwarding**, **SSL automation**, and **monitoring**

Let’s begin by setting up Pi-hole.  

---

## 1. Installing and Configuring Pi-hole

### 1.1 Prerequisites

Before installing Pi-hole, ensure you have:

- A Debian/Ubuntu-based system or a Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS (Lite).
- Docker and Docker Compose (if installing via containers).

Install Docker and Docker Compose on Debian/Ubuntu:  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```
For detailed steps, refer to the official Pi-hole install docs.

### 1.2 One-Step Automated Installation

For a quick setup, Pi-hole offers an automated installer:  
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```
Review installer prompts to set upstream DNS, static IP, and web admin password.

### 1.3 Docker Container Deployment

If you prefer containers, use the official Pi-hole Docker image:  
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  pihole:
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    container_name: pihole
    network_mode: "host"
    environment:
      TZ: "UTC"
      WEBPASSWORD: "<strongAdminPassword>"
      DNS1: "127.0.0.1#5335"
    volumes:
      - ./pihole/data:/etc/pihole
      - ./pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d
    restart: unless-stopped
```
See CrossTalk Solutions for detailed instructions on Docker deployment.

### 1.4 Recursive DNS with Unbound

To enhance privacy and bypass external upstream DNS, install **Unbound** for recursive resolution.  
```bash
sudo apt install unbound
```
Create `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf` with:  
```
interface: 127.0.0.1
port: 5335
harden-glue: yes
harden-dnssec-stripped: yes
edns-buffer-size: 1232
prefetch: yes
num-threads: 1
root-hints: "/var/lib/unbound/root.hints"
```
Enable Pi-hole to use Unbound via Settings > DNS > Custom and add `127.0.0.1#5335` as the sole upstream server.

---

## 2. Managing Local DNS Records in Pi-hole

Pi-hole’s **Local DNS** feature centralizes hostname-to-IP mappings, eliminating the need for editing individual hosts files.  

### 2.1 Adding A/AAAA Records

Navigate to **Local DNS Records**:  
- **Domain:** `server-01.home.cyber-bronkc.com`  
- **IP Address:** `192.168.1.10`  

This creates an A record for your server. Repeat for IPv6 (AAAA) as needed.  

### 2.2 Adding CNAME Records

Navigate to **CNAME Records**:  
- **Domain:** `nextcloud.home.cyber-bronkc.com`  
- **Target Domain:** `server-01.home.cyber-bronkc.com`  

CNAMEs simplify updates when the underlying IP changes, as only the A record must be updated.  

### 2.3 Best Practices

- Use **A/AAAA** for fixed hosts (workstations, VMs).  
- Use **CNAME** for services (intranet, media apps).  
- Choose memorable local TLDs (e.g., `.lan`, `.home`).  

These strategies streamline name resolution and reduce administrative overhead.

## 3. Homelab Network Organization

A well-organized network enhances security, performance, and manageability.  

### 3.1 Network Segmentation with VLANs

Segmenting your network isolates traffic and applies tailored security rules. Typical VLANs include:  
- **VLAN 10 (Mgmt):** Routers, switches, firewalls  
- **VLAN 20 (Servers):** Hypervisors, application servers  
- **VLAN 30 (Containers):** Docker/Kubernetes workloads  
- **VLAN 40 (IoT):** Smart home devices (internet-only)  
- **VLAN 50 (Guest):** Internet-only guest Wi-Fi  

Implement VLANs on your core switch and firewall (e.g., pfSense, OPNsense) using 802.1Q tagging.

### 3.2 Server, VM, and Container Best Practices

- Adopt **Infrastructure as Code** (Ansible, Terraform) for VM/container deployments.  
- Use **GitOps** (GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions) to maintain reproducibility.  
- Leverage **Portainer** or **Rancher** for Docker/Kubernetes management.  
- Store configuration files in a **Git repository** for versioning.  
- Use **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for single-node, k3s or Kubernetes for multi-node clusters.  

### 3.3 Storage and Backups

- Place VM/container data on **dedicated storage VLANs** (iSCSI, NFS, Ceph).  
- Automate backups using **Duplicati**, **Veeam Agent**, or **SyncJob**.  
- Snapshots in Proxmox or VMware provide quick restores, but require periodic pruning.

## 4. Reverse Proxy Fundamentals

### 4.1 Why Use a Reverse Proxy

A **reverse proxy** sits between clients and your services, offering:  
- **Single entry point** for multiple services  
- **SSL/TLS termination** for HTTPS encryption  
- **Load balancing** across backend servers  
- **Global server load balancing (GSLB)** for geo-based routing  
- **Caching** to reduce backend load  
- **Security** (WAF, DDoS mitigation) by hiding origin IPs.

### 4.3 Integrating a Reverse Proxy with Pi-hole

To route Pi-hole’s admin UI through a reverse proxy, add a **Proxy Host** in your proxy manager:

1. **Domain Names:** `pihole.home.cyber-bronkc.com`  
2. **Scheme:** `http`  
3. **Hostname/IP:** `192.168.1.2`  
4. **Port:** `80`  
5. **SSL Certificate:** Use wildcard cert  
6. **Force SSL:** Enabled  

This allows secure access without exposing Pi-hole’s default port publicly yet resolves locally via your custom domain.

---

## 5. Domain Name and External Access

### 5.1 Domain Registration and DNS Setup

Purchase a domain (e.g., `home.cyber-bronkc.com`) from a registrar, and point its **nameservers** to your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare) for dynamic DNS and SSL integration.  

### 5.2 Dynamic DNS (DDNS)

If your ISP IP changes:  
- Use Cloudflare API or services like Dynv6 or DuckDNS  
- Automate with `cloudflare-ddns-updater` or `ddclient` to update A/AAAA records.  

Example Cloudflare script snippet:  
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${ZONE_ID}/dns_records/${RECORD_ID}" \
     -H "X-Auth-Email: ${EMAIL}" \
     -H "X-Auth-Key: ${API_KEY}" \
     --data '{"type":"A","name":"home","content":"'${NEW_IP}'"}'
```
Run via cron every 10 minutes for reliability.

### 5.3 SSL/TLS Certificate Automation

Use Let’s Encrypt **DNS-01** challenge for wildcard certificates:  
```yaml
certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/cloudflare.ini \
  -d "*.home.cyber-bronkc.com" \
  -d home.cyber-bronkc.com
```
Or with **Traefik** and Cloudflare integration in Docker Compose:  
```yaml
environment:
  - CF_API_EMAIL=[email protected]
  - CF_API_KEY=YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_KEY
```
Traefik will auto-generate and renew `*.home.cyber-bronkc.com` certificates.

---

## 6. Router Configuration and Port Forwarding

### 6.1 Bridge Mode and DHCP

For advanced segmentation, set your ISP router to **bridge mode** and use your firewall as DHCP server. This eases VLAN and DNS suffix assignment:  
- Assign `dhcp domain-name home.cyber-bronkc.com` for auto DNS suffix.  
- Provide Pi-hole as DHCP DNS server for local name resolution.  

### 6.2 Port Forwarding

Forward only necessary TCP/UDP ports from the public IP to your reverse proxy:  
- HTTP (80) → proxy host  
- HTTPS (443) → proxy host  
- Optional: SSH (22), RDP (3389), game ports  

Use `iptables`/`pfSense` NAT rules or cloud router port forwarding GUI (e.g., HomeLab Host, PureVPN) for mapping..

---

## 7. Network Security and Segmentation

### 7.1 VLAN Isolation

Define VLANs on switches and configure firewall rules to control inter-VLAN traffic:  

| VLAN ID | Name         | Purpose                   | Key Firewall Rules                  |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 10      | Management   | Network infrastructure    | Allow admin subnets, block clients  |
| 20      | Servers      | Homelab servers/VMs       | Allow management, DNS, HTTP(s)      |
| 30      | Containers   | Docker/K8s workloads      | Allow to servers, internet only     |
| 40      | IoT          | Smart home (internet-only)| Deny inter-VLAN, internet only      |
| 50      | Guest        | Guest Wi-Fi               | Internet-only, no LAN access        |

*Table: VLAN Segmentation Strategy*

Avoid VLAN IDs 0 and 1, and assign PVIDs wisely to prevent VLAN hopping attacks.

### 7.2 Firewall and Access Lists

- Use **Cloudflare Access** for external authentication (Zero Trust)  
- Apply **ACLs** in proxy manager to restrict local vs remote access  
- Harden SSH with key-based auth and non-standard ports  
- Employ **WAF** rules in your reverse proxy for application-layer protection  

---

## 8. Monitoring and Logging

Continuous monitoring and logging ensure system health and facilitate troubleshooting:  

### 8.1 Pi-hole Monitoring

Integrate **Netdata** or **Prometheus** with Pi-hole’s API metrics:  
- Pi-hole Exporter for Prometheus:  
  ```bash
  docker run --network host -e PIHOLE_API_TOKEN=... \
     ekofr/pihole-exporter
  ```  
- Netdata module for Pi-hole: built-in support shows DNS queries, blocked domains, client counts.

### 8.2 Prometheus Remote Write

To avoid SD card wear on Raspberry Pis, configure Prometheus local for short retention and use **remote_write** to ship metrics to central Prometheus:  
```yaml
remote_write:
- url: https://prom-server/api/v1/write
  basic_auth:
    username: user
    password: pass
```
This scales for multiple Raspberry Pis and preserves long-term metrics.

### 8.3 Log Aggregation

- Collect reverse proxy logs (Nginx/Traefik)  
- Forward to **ELK** or **Grafana Loki** for centralized analysis  
- Use dashboards to visualize DNS query volume, blocked rates, HTTP errors  

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Maintain **Infrastructure as Code** for consistent deployments  
- **Tag** all server and container images for traceability  
- Rotate or revoke Cloudflare/API tokens regularly  
- Keep Pi-hole adlists updated and prune stale CNAME/A records  
- Automate Pi-hole IPv4/IPv6 blocking with scheduled Gravity updates (pihole -g)  
- Regularly audit port forwarding rules and firewall ACLs for accuracy  
- **Document** network architecture and DNS records in a shared repository  

---

## Conclusion

By integrating Pi-hole for local DNS resolution, segmenting your network with VLANs, leveraging reverse proxies, and automating DNS and SSL tasks, you can build a **secure**, **scalable**, and **manageable** homelab. Centralized monitoring with Prometheus or Netdata ensures continuous visibility into your setup. These best practices will help you maintain a professional-grade homelab that meets both learning and production-grade requirements.
