# Add Homelab monitoring to HomeAssistant

## üß© What You Can Integrate into Home Assistant

### üîπ Pi-hole Integration

- **Stats available**: Total queries, blocked queries, top domains, client activity
- **Bonus**: You can create automations (e.g., notify when blocking spikes)

### üîπ System Monitoring

- **Use `Glances` or `System Monitor`** to track CPU, RAM, disk, and network
- **Install `Glances` on each device** and expose it via API to Home Assistant

### üîπ Network Presence

- Track which devices are online/offline
- Monitor IP addresses and hostnames
- Use `device_tracker` integrations (e.g., via FritzBox or DHCP logs)

### üîπ Docker Containers (if applicable)

- Use `Portainer` or `Docker Monitor` integrations
- See container status, resource usage, uptime

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps

### 1. **Pi-hole Integration**

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
pi_hole:
  host: YOUR_PIHOLE_IP
  api_key: YOUR_PIHOLE_API_KEY
```

Then restart Home Assistant. You‚Äôll get sensors like:

- `sensor.pi_hole_ads_blocked_today`
- `sensor.pi_hole_dns_queries_today`

### 2. **Glances for System Metrics**

Install Glances on your server or device:

```bash
pip install glances
glances -w
```

Then add to Home Assistant:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: glances
    host: DEVICE_IP
    name: DietPi
```

You‚Äôll get sensors for CPU, RAM, disk, etc.

### 3. **FritzBox Device Tracker**

If you haven‚Äôt already:

```yaml
device_tracker:
  - platform: fritz
    host: fritz.box
    username: YOUR_USERNAME
    password: YOUR_PASSWORD
```

This lets you track which devices are connected to your network.

## üñºÔ∏è Dashboard Ideas

- **DNS Panel**: Pi-hole stats, top blocked domains
- **System Panel**: CPU/RAM/disk usage per device
- **Network Panel**: Online/offline status, IPs, hostnames
- **Alerts Panel**: Automations for overheating, offline devices, DNS spikes

Would you like me to help design a Lovelace dashboard layout or YAML config for these panels? Or maybe a custom card setup with graphs and gauges?
